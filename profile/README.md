# Terra Theme

Terra is a multi-platform theme collection with nature inspired themes for each season, with a day and night variant.

## ðŸš§ &nbsp;Status: Early development &nbsp;ðŸš§</p>

This theme is in an early development phase.

Things and colors can (and will) change.

This is all a work in progress.

When I am finished with the VSCode variant for the theme, I will continue to work on [Neovim](https://github.com/terra-theme/nvim), Obsidian and [Terminal](https://github.com/terra-theme/terminal) variants.

**Contribution will be possible and encouraged, if the base steps and infrastructure is ready.**

## Themes

- Spring (Day & Night)
- Summer (Day & Night)
